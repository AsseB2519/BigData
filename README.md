# Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Global Inflation and Migration

This project was conducted for the practical project for the Smart Analysis in Big Data Systems course within the Master's in Computer Engineering program at the University of Minho. It aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various socio-economic variables, including inflation, migration, GDP, unemployment, population, tax rates, and COVID-19 statistics. The analysis is conducted on a global scale, with a specific focus on G8 and G20 countries as well as different continents. Utilizing comprehensive datasets and advanced data processing tools such as Pandas and Apache Spark, the project derives meaningful insights into these variables and their interrelations during the pre-pandemic period, the pandemic period and the post-pandemic period.
