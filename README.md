# COVID-19's Influence on Global Socio-Economic Landscape

This project was conducted for the practical project for the Smart Analysis in Big Data Systems course within the Master's in Computer Engineering program at the University of Minho. It aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various socio-economic variables, including **Inflation**, **Migration**, **Gross Domestic Product** (GDP), **Unemployment**, **Population**, **Tax rates** and **COVID-19** statistics. The analysis is conducted on a global scale, with a specific focus on **G8** and **G20** countries as well as different **Continents**. Utilizing comprehensive datasets and advanced data processing tools such as **Pandas** and **Apache Spark**, the project derives meaningful insights into these variables and their interrelations during the pre-pandemic period and the pandemic period as well.
